generations:
  - name: "First Generation (P10)"
    start_year: 1991
    end_year: 1996
    description: "The original Infiniti G20 was a compact luxury sedan based on the Nissan Primera, introduced to compete with entry-level European luxury cars like the BMW 3 Series and Audi 80. Featuring conservative styling typical of early 1990s Japanese sedans, it emphasized handling and driving dynamics over outright luxury. Powered by a 2.0L four-cylinder engine producing 140 HP, paired with either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission, it offered modest performance with a focus on refinement. The interior featured good build quality with standard leather on most trims, though design and materials were more mainstream than truly luxurious. Notable for its multi-link front suspension that provided handling characteristics praised by automotive journalists, the G20 established itself as the driver-focused option in Infiniti's early lineup. This generation laid the groundwork for the G nameplate that would eventually become central to Infiniti's brand identity, though the original G20 achieved only modest sales success against more established luxury competitors."

  - name: "Second Generation (P11)"
    start_year: 1999
    end_year: 2002
    description: "After a brief hiatus, the G20 returned with updated styling that maintained the conservative approach of its predecessor. Still based on the Nissan Primera, it featured improved refinement and slightly enhanced performance from the same 2.0L four-cylinder engine, now producing 145 HP. The interior saw incremental improvements in materials and features, though it remained modest by luxury standards of the era. This generation continued to emphasize handling and driving dynamics, with the 'touring' package offering sportier suspension tuning and larger wheels. Despite these enhancements, the G20 struggled against increasingly sophisticated European and Japanese competitors, leading to its discontinuation in 2002. The P11 G20 served as a transitional model in Infiniti's history, maintaining a presence in the entry-luxury segment while the brand developed the rear-wheel drive G35 that would dramatically change Infiniti's fortunes and image."

  - name: "Third Generation (V35)"
    start_year: 2003
    end_year: 2006
    description: "The G35 represented a complete reinvention of the G sedan, moving to Nissan's FM (Front Midship) rear-wheel drive platform shared with the Nissan 350Z sports car. Featuring distinctive styling with a long hood, short deck proportions, and flowing lines, it signaled Infiniti's new design direction and performance focus. Powered by a 3.5L VQ-series V6 engine initially producing 260 HP (later increased to 280 HP), paired with a five-speed automatic or six-speed manual transmission, it offered performance comparable to the benchmark BMW 3 Series. Available in rear-wheel or all-wheel drive configurations, it emphasized sporty handling while offering luxury amenities. The interior featured a driver-focused cockpit with good materials and a distinctive, tiered dashboard design. This generation established the G sedan as a legitimate contender in the sport-luxury segment, winning numerous awards and dramatically enhancing Infiniti's credibility and market position against established German and Japanese luxury brands."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (V36)"
    start_year: 2007
    end_year: 2013
    description: "The G37 sedan (later simply called the G sedan) evolved the successful formula of its predecessor with more muscular styling, enhanced performance, and improved luxury features. Built on an updated version of the FM platform, it featured more aggressive design elements while maintaining the athletic proportions of the G35. Powered by a larger 3.7L VQ-series V6 producing 328 HP, paired with a seven-speed automatic or six-speed manual transmission, it offered improved performance and refinement. The interior saw significant enhancements in material quality, design, and technology, featuring Infiniti's first implementation of the dual-touchscreen infotainment system in later model years. Available in various trim levels including the luxury-oriented Journey and sport-focused Sport models, plus all-wheel drive variants, it offered configurations for different buyer preferences. This generation maintained the G sedan's position as Infiniti's volume model and brand cornerstone, competing effectively against the BMW 3 Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class, and other established luxury sport sedans. In 2014, as part of Infiniti's nomenclature change, the G sedan was renamed Q50, bringing an end to the G designation that had become synonymous with Infiniti's sport-luxury identity."
